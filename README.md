![btc prices predcition](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d13986c-c9a4-4591-b765-22235e9a57bc)

This project offers a dynamic upgrade to my earlier [Bitcoin Predictive Analytics](https://github.com/dlzcods/bitcoin-predictive-analytics) project. It automates the data acquisition process, pulling fresh data daily from the CoinPaprika API. The pipeline includes data processing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

The implementation of GitHub Actions presented some initial challenges, especially in handling data artifacts. However, these were successfully overcome, enabling a fully automated and up-to-date prediction system.
